# Lab01

EECE2080C Lab 01  
Revised 20-Sep-2022

Objective: The goal of this lab is to practice implementing C++ classes, dealing with pointer, memory allocation, memory deletion.

See Code and Lab Report Standards - https://github.com/olekaspt/LabStandards

Assignment:
1.	Access Lab01 code by cloning this repo - git clone https://github.com/olekaspt/Lab01.git  
1.	Run the Unit Tests and see that some of them fail.   Now we are ready to provide the implementation needed to ArrayBasedLinkedList and PointerBasedLinkedList.
1.	Specifically provide an implementation for the methods that have //TODO comments.  The behavior desired can be inferred from comments and\or UnitTests.
1.	Things to keep in mind, try not to change the signature and data members of class.   As you will only be providing LinkedList.cpp.   So you shouldnâ€™t modify the signature/structure so that the UnitTests will not compile.  As the UnitTests are going to be used to grade the HW.


The grade on this assignment will be determined by:  
75% On having the testcases passing (see note in syllabus about dishonesty)
25% on code style and programming

Participation Rubric
